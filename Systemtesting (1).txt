user acceptance testing
====================================>

System Testing:--->

	=> System testing conduct by Blackbox testing team,
	=> During this test tester verify external functionality 
	   of software.


System Testing is categorized into two types.
	1. Functional testing     [How software is working]
	2. Non functional testing [how Software is performing]


Functional testing:-->
	=> During this testing, Test-Engineer verify core 
		requirements of client at user interface.
	
	=> Checking customer expectation is fulfilled
	   at end user level.

	=> End user level testing..

		1.Behavioural /GUI testing 
		2.Input testing
		3.Output testing
		4.Error handling
		5.DB-Testing [Backend testing]
		6.Links coverage


	1. Behavioral testing:-->
		During this test Test-Engineer verify availability of each screen
			and each screen response to End user.
			
		What Exactly tester verify here?
			=> launching software pages and responses..




	Graphical User Interface Testing [GUI]

		During this test Test-Engineer verify look and feel of software
			from front page..
		
		=> Verify font sizes
		=> Verify color,Background color of elements
		=> Verify page alignments  [Margins, Padding ---etc.]
		=> Verify images at page
		=> Verify cursor position
		=> verify cursor types
		=> Verify All Menu tabs
		=> Login forms and registration forms alignment
		=> Highlighters and active tabs

	2.Input-Domain Testing:-->
		During this testing Test-Engineer verify whether software is accepting
		valid inputs from end-user.
		
		=> Verify user can enter text into edit box
		=> Verify user can select input from Dropdown
		=> Verify user can select radio buttons
		=> Verify user can select checkboxes
		=> Verify user can use mouse and keyboard inputs at software.
		=> Verify user can select option from list box
		=> Verify user can select date from date picker
		=> Verify user can select multiple options from list boxes [Optional]
		=> Verify user can operate software using touch actions
		=> Verify user able to click buttons, links, selection items
		=> Verify user able to access sub categories by hovering on Main 
		categories
		
	3.Output-Domain Testing:-->

		During this testing Test Engineer operate software 
		using valid credentials/inputs to verify 
		correctness of output.

		=> Typed characters visible at edit box
		=> All radio buttons and checkboxes generating rules as expected
		=> verify Selected dropdown option populated
		=> Selected date visible at calendar.
		=> Verify status messages displayed at webpage after operated 	
		   software with valid data.
		=> Verify Expected image/object/text available at webpage.
		=> Verify object visible and hidden  behavior according to input entry
		=> verify object enable and disable behavior according to input entry
		=> Verify checkbox and  radio button status after selection and deselection
		=> Verify expected popup messages display to convey status messages
		=> Verify expected data records are showing at web tables.
		=> verify child feature displayed after parent entry successful

               4. Error handling:-->

		During this testing Test Engineer operate software 
		with invalid inputs to verify software is
		preventing those actions and display appropriate
		error messages to end-user.


		=> Verify appropriate error message displayed on invalid data
		=> Verify popup message displayed on incorrect operations
		=> Verify info message displayed when order missing
		=> Verify error message displayed when Field leavy empty but it 
		   expected as mandatory field
		=> Verify table records show "Records not available" when user try empty search 
					or by missing required records
		=> Verify input entry at edit box when text box is in readable mode
		=> verify user actions on disable element
		=> verify click functionality of button  or link when object is inactive


	   5. Illegal handling:-->
		During this testing test engineer purposely hack software with illegal
		approach and verify whether software is preventing user to access.


		=> To many invalid attempts to access password
		=> Guessing passwords
		=> Bookmark a page after successful login..
		=> verify page not allowed user to access page source
		=> verify user able to take screenshot of page when it is not allowed
		=> Handle captcha using automation tools
		=> Copying encrypted password

	5. DB-testing:-->
		=> Also known as backend testing


	1. Data mapping:-->

	=> Also called as data validity
	=> Checking connection of new database tables and forms.

		verify that respective tables and records are 
		updated when the user clicks  Save ,  Update , 
		 Search  or  Delete  from GUI of the application.


	2. Data integrity:--->

		Consider that different modules (i.e. screens or forms) of 	
		application use the same data. In that case, 
		make it sure that the latest state of data is reflected 
		everywhere..


		Note:-->
		SIT-[System Integration Testing]
		System integrity or End to End System Integration testing
		done by functional testing team at user interface 
		of software
		
	5.LinksCoverage:--->
	
		Links play key role in web applications. To test links at webpage
		follow below checklist.

	=> Verify if any broken images and links at webpage
	=> Verify administrator links opening third party tools.
	=> Verify all external links open page at private window.
	=> Verify all hyperlinks connect intersystem softwares..
	=> Verify secure pages opening in incognito window.
