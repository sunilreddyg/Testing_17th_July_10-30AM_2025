Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium

The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern 
commonly used in test automation to create an 
object repository for web UI elements. 

This model helps in reducing code duplication and
 improving test maintenance. In POM, 
 each web page in the application is represented
 by a corresponding Page Class. 
 This Page Class identifies the web elements 
 of that web page and contains methods to perform
 operations on these elements.
