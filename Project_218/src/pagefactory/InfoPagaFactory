Page Factory is a design pattern in Selenium 
that simplifies the implementation of the 
Page Object Model (POM). 

It provides an efficient way to initialize 
web elements and reduces boilerplate code by 
using annotations. 

This approach enhances code readability, 
maintainability, and reusability in 
test automation.
