Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming 
paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure 
code in a more modular, reusable, and maintainable way.



The main OOP concepts in Java are 
	Encapsulation, 
	Inheritance, 
	Polymorphism, 
	Abstraction, 
	Classes, and Objects
	
	
	Encapsulation:-->
	Encapsulation is the practice of restricting 
	access to certain fields and methods using 
	access modifiers (private, public, protected), 
	and providing getter/setter methods to access 
	private data...
